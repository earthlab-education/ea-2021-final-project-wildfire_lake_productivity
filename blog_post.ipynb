    "### Trees and plants affect lake color\n",
    "   The forests in the US Southwest have been altered by changes in wildfire patterns. They are especially affected by increased fire severity (Chambers et al. 2016, Malone et al. 2016, Coop et al. 2020 and others). Tree and vegetation regrowth is often slow or non-existant after high severity fires. It is expected that in some burned Ponderosa forests, trees may not recover at all in our lifetimes.  They may instead be replaced by shrubs and grasslands (Chambers et al. 2016, Kerns et al. 2018). \n",
    "\n",
    "   Vegetation within water catchments regulates water quality through controlled retention and release of nutrients. However, when vegetation is burned in a wildfire,  the demand of nutrients is drastically and suddenly reduced (Rhoades et al. 2019). Additionally, severely burned soils can be come water resistant or 'hydrophobic' (Reale et al. 2015). The combination of these wildfire effects means that in post-fire rainfall, nutrients and sediment travel downhill towards streams and lakes like muddy, fertilized raindrops on a Gore-Tex coat. Many studies demonstrate increased nutrient and sediment content in streams with burned catchments, which reduces the quality of stream water and can change the ecosystems within them. However, little research has been done to measure changes in the quality and function of lakes affected by wildfire. \n",

    "Wildfires may have potentially similar or more severe consequences for lakes (McCullough et al. 2018). Unlike streams and rivers, lakes have much longer water residence times. This means sediment and nutrients can remain in and affect lakes long after they have settled or washed out of the streams above them. This is a concern for the US. Southwest as many communities, particularly those among or along the Rocky Mountain range, rely on forested mountain watersheds for potable or clean water (Figure 1). \n",

    "There are a several of recently developed datasets that match Landsat satellite observations to *in-situ* or on-the-ground field measurements for waterbodies within the continental United States (i.e. LimnoSat by Topp et al. 2020, AquaSat by Ross et al. 2018).  LimnoSat provides the 'deepest point' caluclation for each lake and identifies color of a 120m diameter circle surrounding each point from Landsat satellites 5, 7, and 8.\n",
    "In this project, we used those deepest points, available through [Google Earth Engine](https://code.earthengine.google.com/4b49c096f90206995d89b87eb528a386) to identify lakes within Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico. We then drew a 2km buffer around each of those points that served as an estimate of the catchment area, or an area of land that could potentially affect the water quality in the lake.\n",
    "Then, we compared these 'catchments' to the [Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity](https://www.mtbs.gov/direct-download) burn areas and identified lakes that had catchments that overlapped with burn areas (Figure 2).  We then matched these points to the [LimnoSat](https://zenodo.org/record/4139695) color reflectance dataset to generate our own dataset of burned lakes and all of their Landsat imagery since 1984."

    "To determine if satellite imagery detected changes in lake colors, the color wavelengths were plotted over time. Some examples from Colorado fire-affected lakes are shown below, with the ignition date of recent wildfires shown as a red, dashed, vertical line. Dates in these figures where converted to the number of years before or after the fire ignition.  To minimize seasonal effects on lake color, only July and August images were gathered from the dataset for the images below. When reviewing the annual range of color trends within individual lakes, we can see that the color trends differ among them. The Rampart Reservoir in the Pikes Peak/central region of the state reflects an increase in wavelength (a shift from bluer to greener) several years post fire, whereas the Seaman Reservoir in Northern Colorado shows that this green shift occurs in the years immediately prior to, during and after the fire. The Lemon Reservoir and Lake George reflect little change except for brief green shifts in one summer post-fire."
