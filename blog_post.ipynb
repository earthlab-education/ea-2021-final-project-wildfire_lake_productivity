    "Forest composition and structure in the Colorado Front Range has been altered by changes to wildfire regimes, especially increased fire severity (Chambers et al. 2016, Malone et al. 2016, Coop et al. 2020 and others). Subsequently, reduced post-fire tree canopy regrowth often results in chronic impacts to upland ecological function and water quality. Vegetation within forested water catchments regulates water quality through retention and release of nutrients. However, vegetation mortality due to wildfire instantaneously reduces plant demand of nutrients (Rhoades et al. 2019) and in combination with hydrophobic soils (Reale et al. 2015), results in high post-fire erosional sediment and nutrient inputs to headwater streams and may have potentially similar or more severe consequences for lakes (McCullough et al. 2018). Unlike streams and rivers, lakes have much longer water residence times than streams which may result in prolonged fire effects. This is a concern for the US. Southwest as many communities, including the Colorado Front Range, rely on forested montane watersheds for clean drinking water (Figure 1). Water clarity and color can be used as proxies for water quality because they respond to ecological processes within the watershed (Topp et al. 2020). Gardner et al. (2020) and Topp et al. (2020) have demonstrated that long term and seasonal changes in water clarity and color be identified using NIR/red and blue/green ratios, as well as color indices (e.g. the Forel-Ule Color Index (Wang et al. 2015)) collected from Landsat imagery.

    "There are a several of recently developed datasets that match landsat observations to *in-situ* or on-the-ground field measurements for waterbodies within the continental United States (i.e. LimnoSat by Topp et al. 2020, AquaSat by Ross et al. 2018).  LimnoSat provides the 'deepest' point caluclation for each lake within the HydroLAKES dataset, extracts summary optical properties surrounding each point from Landsat 5, 7, and 8, and offers a dataset of reflectance values that have been standardized across sensors.   \n",
    "I subset LimnoSat's deepest point shapefile, an asset available through [Google Earth Engine](https://code.earthengine.google.com/4b49c096f90206995d89b87eb528a386)  to identify lakes within Colorado and matched these points to the [LimnoSat](https://zenodo.org/record/4139695) reflectance dataset.\n",

    "From the overlapping points, tablular data from the LimnoSat dataset and burn initiation dates of the MTBS dataset were plotted. The dominant wavelength supplied by Limnosat was determined using median values of red, green and blue landsat bands and the angle of reflectance. We can use the dominant wavelength as a color indicator and plot values over time to observe pre- and post-fire index trends. Each landsat image was classifed as pre- or post-fire and the number of days between burn ignition and Landsat image were caluculated to determine distance from fire in days or years. To minimize seasonal effects on lake color, only one or two months at a time were reviewed.  As an example, July and August images are gathered from the dataset for the images below. When reviewing the annual distribution of color trends within individual lakes, we can see that the responses and resilience differs among them. On the x-axis of the figures below, the time since fire is represented in years.  These are just a few lakes in the dataset selected to exemplify the differences in response. The Rampart Reservoir in the Pikes Peak/central region of the state reflects an increase in wavelength (a shift toward red) several years post fire, whereas the Seaman Reservoir in Northern Colorado shows a red shift the years immediate prior to, during and after. The Lemon Reservoir and Lake George reflect little change except for brief red shifts post-fire."

    "This project will continue over the next six weeks by undertaking several steps to identify the drivers behind the differences in color response among lakes. Within each lake polygon, I will attempt to characterize fire effects by calculating the proportion of each burn severity level and the total area burned.  Additionally, landscape characteristics like vegetation coverage, climate patterns and soil characteristics will be added to the analysis from the Earth Engine API within Python which will allow for data collection among many sources. In-situ data of chlorophyll concentrations from AquaSat will be merged with the burned dataset above and will be used as a response variable to train a random forest model.  From the model output, I hope to identify the most influential drivers of changes to lake color post-fire, and gain an understanding of why lakes may respond differently in terms of remotely sensed color.
